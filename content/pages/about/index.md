Welcome to the Brown Math DUG Journal! We are an online platform that showcases research by members of the Math Department Undergraduate Group (DUG) at Brown University.

We aim to provide a platform for undergraduate mathematicians to develop their research skills, engage in intellectual discourse, and contribute to mathematical knowledge.
