## Motivation:
LaTeX is a popular typesetting system used for writing scientific and technical documents. However, when it comes to creating a blog post or webpage, Markdown is a more convenient format.

## Gathering the Required Libraries
To get started, make sure you have [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system. The script utilizes the following libraries:

- **os**: for path manipulation and file operations
- **re**: for regular expression matching and replacement
- **datetime**: for generating the current date and time

These libraries should be on your machine with your install of Python

## Running the Script
Complete the [steps](https://mathdugresearch.netlify.app/posts/step-by-step-guide-to-start-writing-on-here#add-your-article) till "Create a new markdown file". In your preferred IDE (or terminal), open the repository and find the "[addpost.py](https://github.com/Geoc2022/BrownMathDUG_Research/blob/main/content/posts/addpost.py)" script under "content/post". Move your LaTeX file to the "content/posts" folder. Run the python script using your IDE (or "python3 addpost.py" on your terminal), and answer the questions prompted by the script. Then complete the [steps](https://mathdugresearch.netlify.app/posts/step-by-step-guide-to-start-writing-on-here#add-your-article) starting from "Stage the file".
